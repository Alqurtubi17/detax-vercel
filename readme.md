# Detax (Deteksi Berita Hoax)
Detax is a machine learning-based application for detecting hoax news and narratives. It aims to provide a tool to help users identify misleading or false information in news articles and narratives.

## Features
* Hoax News Detection: Detax utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze news articles and determine the likelihood of them being hoaxes.
* Narrative Analysis: In addition to news articles, Detax can also analyze narratives and identify potential hoax elements or misleading information.
* User-friendly Interface: The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to submit articles or narratives for analysis and view the results.

## Technologies Used
* Python: The core programming language used for developing the machine learning models and application logic.
* Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP techniques are employed to preprocess and analyze textual data, extract features, and train the machine learning models.
* Machine Learning Libraries: Detax utilizes popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch to build and train the hoax detection models.
* Web Development: The application's user interface is built using web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a web framework Flask.
